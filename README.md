Making a daily planner for a homework project

This project took me a while for my head to wrap around. finally after 4hours of trying to start we got the first few lines of code. Then 5 hours later Blaise and I worked together and figured it out with more code than needed but it worked!

I didnt have time to bring this to my website but i will have it up there with my own version of the HTML during break.
